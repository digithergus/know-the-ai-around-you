# know-the-ai-around-you
This is a theoretical concept as of now. You can say it as AI which has a human-level of functioning, across a wide variety of domains such as language processing, image processing, computational functioning and reasoning pretty much human isn’t it. You will still a long way away from building an AGI system. This AGI system might need to comprise of thousands of Artificial Narrow Intelligence systems working in tandem, communicating with each other to mimic humans. Even with the most advanced computer systems and infrastructures, it almost took 40 minutes for Fujitsu’s K and IBM’s Watson to simulate a single second of neuronal activity. This speaks to both the immense complexity and interconnectedness of the human brain, and to the magnitude of the challenge of building an AGI with our current resources.
